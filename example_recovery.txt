We will create a citus cluster with 2 workers. Create and distribute a table named xx. Insert 15m rows into it. 
Take restore point so that we will get back to that point. Insert 15m rows again. Currently we have 30m rows in xx. 
After that, we will restore to old state. Now we can verify we have 15m rows.


1. Create optumCluster with citus_dev with 2 workers. (citus_dev make optumCluster --destroy)
2. Stop cluster. (citus_dev stop optumCluster)
3. Run cluster_prepare_archiving.sh (bash cluster_prepare_archiving.sh "<node_names>")
4. Start cluster. (citus_dev start optumCluster)
5. Take backups. (bash cluster_take_basebackup.sh "<node_names>" <backup_date>)
6. Create table and insert records. (create table xx(id int); select create_distributed_table('xx','id'); insert into xx select i from generate_series(1,15000000);)
7. Create restore points. (bash cluster_create_restore_points.sh <coordinator_name> <restore_point_name>)
8. Insert more records (insert into xx select i from generate_series(1,15000000);)
9. Stop cluster. (citus_dev stop optumCluster)

10. Run cluster_restore_start.sh (bash cluster_restore_start.sh "<node_names>" <backup_date> <restore_point_name>)
11. Connect to coordinator and make sanity checks.
12. Run cluster_restore_finish.sh (bash cluster_restore_finish.sh "<node_names>")
